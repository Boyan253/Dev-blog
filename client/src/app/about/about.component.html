        <p>Hello there! My name is <strong>Boyan</strong>, and I'm delighted to welcome you to my online development
            blog. At the
            age of 18, I'm a passionate JavaScript programmer with expertise in various technologies such as
            <strong>React,
                Express, Angular, TypeScript, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>As a dedicated web developer, I find joy in crafting engaging and interactive user experiences through my
            coding skills. I'm particularly fascinated by the realms of software engineering and <b

        <h5 class="mt-5">My Skills and Experiences</h5>
        <p>During my programming journey, I have gained a diverse range of skills and experiences that have shaped me
            into a well-rounded developer. Currently, I am studying programming with JavaScript, React, Angular, and
            Express at SoftUni University. Additionally, I am constantly expanding my knowledge through self-study and
            learning from online resources.</p>
        <p>Over the past year and a half, I have dedicated myself to programming and have completed numerous projects
            that have helped me solidify my skills. I have worked on various types of projects, including video games,
            social networks, and a wide range of web applications and sites.</p>
        <p>Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience in building interactive and dynamic web
            applications. I am proficient in JavaScript, utilizing its powerful features to develop functional and
            efficient code. With React and Angular, I have built modern and responsive user interfaces, leveraging their
            component-based architectures and powerful ecosystem of libraries.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I have experience working with Express, a popular Node.js framework, to develop server-side
            applications and RESTful APIs. This has allowed me to create robust and scalable back-end solutions for my
            projects.</p>
        <p>My passion for programming drives me to continuously learn and stay up-to-date with the latest industry
            trends and best practices. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set.</p>
        <p>Overall, my combined academic studies and self-taught experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in
            programming. I am confident in my abilities to tackle complex problems, collaborate effectively, and deliver
            high-quality solutions.</p>
        <p>I am excited to apply my skills and experiences to new projects and further enhance my capabilities as a
            developer.</p>
